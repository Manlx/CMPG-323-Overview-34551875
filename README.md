        This is the head project which will be used to document the up coming projects.
    </h1>
    <p>
        Each Project will have it's own repository that we can use to keep the project files organized and sorted.
    </p>
    <h2>The general rule for each project regarding the branching is:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are three Branches: Main/Master, Hot Fix and Development.</li>
        <li>Master/Main is the stable ready to release branch</li>
        <li>Hot fix is their for small updates to fix minor issues</li>
        <li>Development is there for feature development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Depending on the project the git ignore will be configured to ignore cache/compile files of said project type.
    </h2>
    <p>For example: For a C# Project is going to ignore the "bin","obj" folders.</p>
    <h2>In most cases to secure confidential data the project will most likely implement a JSON file which will be ignored.</h2>
    <p>For example: If a database log in / API key will be stored in the JSON which will NOT be on the repository.</p>
